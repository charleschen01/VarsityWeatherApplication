# Interaction_Design

This project consists of a desktop application which simulates a smartphone application for weather information for skiers.
The code is released as-is.

## Instructions to run:
- The code comes with project files for IntelliJ IDEA
- Simply load the project directory into IntelliJ and run the code from the WeatherApp.java file
- You may need to install JavaFX onto your system if it is not installed already

## Used libraries:
- The project uses the JavaFX library to implement the GUI
- It also uses the [JSON-java](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java) (also known as org.json) library for parsing JSON response strings from the API.
- Otherwise, only the standard Java libraries were used

## Resources:
- Weather data and symbols sourced from [Weather Unlocked](http://developer.weatherunlocked.com/)
